      <p2>The <span class="bold-text">Republic Act No. 9344</span>, also known as the <span class="bold-text">"Juvenile Justice and Welfare Act of 2006,"</span> marks a pivotal legislative initiative in the Philippines aimed at safeguarding the rights and well-being of children in conflict with the law. Enacted to uphold the principles of restorative justice, the scope of this landmark legislation extends beyond punitive measures, emphasizing rehabilitation and reintegration into society for juvenile offenders. The Act establishes a comprehensive framework that promotes a child-centered approach, acknowledging the unique vulnerabilities and developmental needs of young individuals in the criminal justice system. It introduces diversion programs and alternative interventions, steering away from traditional punitive measures, and enforces a restorative justice model that fosters the rehabilitation of juvenile offenders. Furthermore, the law recognizes the importance of collaboration among various stakeholders, including government agencies, non-governmental organizations, and communities, to ensure a holistic and supportive environment for the juvenile justice system. In essence, the Juvenile Justice and Welfare Act of 2006 reflects a progressive and humane perspective, striving to balance the imperatives of public safety with the imperative to protect and rehabilitate the youth involved in the criminal justice system.

            </section>
            <section id="age">
                <h2>2. Age of Criminal Responsibility:</h2>
                <p>One of the significant provisions of RA 9344 is the determination of the age of criminal responsibility. The law sets the minimum age of criminal responsibility at 15 years old. This means that children below 15 years old at the time of the commission of an offense are exempt from criminal liability.</p>
                <section id="diversion">
                    <h2>3. Diversion Programs:</h2>
                    <p>The law emphasizes the use of diversion programs as an alternative to the formal court proceedings. It encourages the adoption of community-based interventions and rehabilitation programs for children in conflict with the law, focusing on their best interests and well-being.</p>
                </section>
                <section id="rights">
                    <h2>4. Rights of the Child:</h2>
